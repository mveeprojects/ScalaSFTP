# ScalaSFTP

### Docker Compose

This project utilises the [SBT Native Packager](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager) plugin to generate the app image amd the [SBT Docker Compose](https://github.com/Tapad/sbt-docker-compose) plugin for orchestrating containers.

### Alpakka FTP library

The [Alpakka FTP library](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current/ftp.html) has been chosen for this repo as it supports both FTP and SFTP integration ad I am interested in learning how to stream directory contents from an SFTP server.
